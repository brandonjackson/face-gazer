extracting pupil vs eyelashes:
this is probably best: size/area covered wrt cropped frame
distance/relation to perkinje images
compare to hough circle position and size
use histograms of areas enclosed by either hough or ellipses
find it at the beginning with user input by tracking changing position and radius of hough circles. - a good way to figure out where to crop and how big the pupil is going to be. can be during the calibration period.


cropping frame dynamically:
use glasses to cut out upper right margins
