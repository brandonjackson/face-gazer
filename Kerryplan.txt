Plan

1: finish reading through all of Brandon's code
2: Look through some functions like template matching and thresholding
3: Look at good features to track
4: Look at methods for finding pupil center in other papers 
5: Work on accurately detecting pupil center and fitting an elipse to it
(do this before trying to speed things up because you will discover new
techniques on the way as well as learn what effective methods may be). Use
hacks if you need to because you can go back and make it more dynamic later.
5: Look at use of perkinje images in others' work
6: Implement using perkinje images or at least be able to track them if you
can't make use of them yet
7: Look at calibration schemes in others' work
8: get a calibration scheme working
9: speed it up
10: make it as autonomous as possible
